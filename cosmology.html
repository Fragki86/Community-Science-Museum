        <h2 class="h2-exhibition-sections">The Sky Above Us</h2>
            <p>For thousands of years humans have studied the night sky and found shapes in the stars. Constellations
                are groups of stars that form a recognizable pattern. They helped ancient humans find their way, and 
                today they help astronomers navigate around the starry sky and locate particular galaxies, nebulas, and
                other space objects. They are also fun for backyard stargazers to find and enjoy. Learn more about
                constellations and how to locate them into the night sky with interesting activities that we provide daily. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="h2-exhibition-sections">Astronomy for Beginners</h2>
            <p>Whether you’re spotting planets with the naked eye or finding galaxies with a telescope, there are lots 
                of ways you can take in the wonders of the universe from the comfort of Earth. It doesn’t take much skill 
                or equipment to get started with stargazing or amateur astronomy, and you can do it almost anywhere.
                Whether you use an app, binoculars, telescope, or just your eyes, there is much to discover. We are going
                to show you how to pick the right spot and how to get oriented in the night sky. As well you will be shown
                how to use simple equipment to guide through the solar system and how to make this equipment by your
                own so that it will help you in your early stages of your exploration.
            </p>
            <p>Follow with us the journey of how different civilizations went through the night sky exploration and they 
                developed their orientation skills. See how the technics of Arab traders differ from the Northern civilizations. 
                How Galileo created the telescope and his discovery made a breakthrough into the astronomy science and 
                how the technology has progressed through time and what is capable of doing now.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h2-exhibition-sections">Seasonal Observations</h2>
            <h3 class="h3-for-text-titles">Meteor Showers</h3>
            <p>Usually during December and January we arrange an observation for the best meteor shower of the year. 
                During this arrangement you can learn about meteors and how these showers are created as well as how to 
                observe them and follow them. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-for-text-titles">Eclipses</h3>
            <p>During the summer period observations about sun-eclipses are arranged so that you can see with your eyes
                this fantastic phenomenon with safety and to gain knowledge about it.
