          <p>Community Science Museum offers a variety of exhibitions that attract both children and adults. We focus on the educational aspects of our exhibits
             by presenting them to the audience in a way that will be memorable for a long time after their visit. Everybody has the right for knowledge and 
             here you can learn about Newtonian physics,  how our world progressed through the centuries and how the ecosystem around us works. Among these as
             well you can attend many experiments about renewable energy, the spectacular world of AI and learn how biology and medicine come together to help 
             humanity.
          </p>
          <p>The majority of our exhibitions have an interactive style, something that makes them even more attractive for big and small children.
          </p>
          <p>We try to change our exhibitions every time we think that something exciting has come up and it needs to be shown to the public. The time that an 
             exhibition is open to the public varies between 6-12 months and we always announce in advance the last day of them. 
          </p>
          <p>We would like your feedback and your thoughts about the current exhibitions after your visit, as well with possible wishes or suggestions that you 
             may have for a future exhibition.
          </p>

            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, 
               explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around 
               us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a 
               bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. 
            </p>
            <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s 
               telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

          <img src="images/evolution.jpg" alt="evolution of human sceleton" class="img-exhibition-groups">
          <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our 
           origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed
           his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding 
           our place in this world.
          </p>
          <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have 
             evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who 
             didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of 
             dinosaurs too.

          <img src="images/biology-medicine.jpg" alt="a child is looking though microscope" class="img-exhibition-groups">
          <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are 
             offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
          </p>
          <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much 
             improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of 
             exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major 
             breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
          </p>
          <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also 
             from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

          <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the 
             more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
             not just for humans but for the whole planet. 
          </p>
          <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face 
             including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on 
             the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.

          <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the 
             science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of 
             robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the
             Robot. 
          </p>
          <p>The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist us in 
             our daily life. You are going to experience the procedure of how the robots are 
             getting from 'scrap-metal' to operative programmed objects and what it takes to 
             make them functionable.

          <p>Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources or 
             processes that are constantly replenished. For example, sunlight or wind keep 
             shining and blowing, even if their availability depends on time and weather.
          </p>
          <p>You can learn and see how these technologies are going to affect the future of 
             power supplying in our daily lives.
